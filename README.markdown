# What are the Managed Commons? #
	
A set of libraries for .NET/Mono, BSD licensed, for help in many areas of programming.
 
The best known example is __Commons.GetOptions__ for command line arguments parsing, the evolution of the years-old Mono.GetOptions library, distributed with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). 
I created Mono.GetOptions, but now it is frozen, so the evolution is going to happen in this Managed Commons project.

Also included __Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR__ that has a helper class to convert a numerical value to it's textual representation in Brazilian Portuguese language.

Both libraries above are stable releases.

Newest addition, still in early development, is __Commons.WebM__ which implements a managed codec for the [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/) video format.
