# What are the Managed Commons? #
	
A set of libraries for .NET/Mono, BSD licensed, helping in many areas of programming.
 
The best known example is __Commons.GetOptions__ which is a library for command line arguments parsing. 
It is the evolution of the years-old Mono.GetOptions library, distributed with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). 
I created Mono.GetOptions, but now it is frozen/deprecated in Mono, so the evolution is going to happen in this Managed Commons project.

__Common.GetOptions 1.0 is now available as a Nuget:__ [Commons.GetOptions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Commons.GetOptions).

Also included here is the  __Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR__ library that has a helper class to convert a numerical value 
to it's textual representation in the Brazilian Portuguese language.

Both libraries above are stable releases.

Most development is in C# 5.0+.
