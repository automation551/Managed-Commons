# What are the Managed Commons? #
	
A set of libraries for .NET/Mono, BSD licensed, helping in many areas of programming.
 
The best known example is __Commons.GetOptions__ which is a library for command line arguments parsing. 
It is the evolution of the years-old Mono.GetOptions library, distributed with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). 
I created Mono.GetOptions, but now it is frozen/deprecated in Mono, so the evolution is going to happen in this Managed Commons project.

Also included here is the  __Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR__ library that has a helper class to convert a numerical value 
to it's textual representation in the Brazilian Portuguese language.

Both libraries above are stable releases.

The newest addition, still in very early development, is the __Commons.WebM__ library which implements a managed codec for the [WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/) video format.

Most development is in C# (4.0), but possibly some [Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org/) code can appear for new subprojects.
