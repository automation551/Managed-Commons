# What are the Managed Commons? #
	
A set of libraries for .NET/Mono, MIT licensed, helping in many areas of programming.
 
The best known example is __Commons.GetOptions__ which is a library for command line arguments parsing. 
It is the evolution of the years-old Mono.GetOptions library, distributed with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). 
I created Mono.GetOptions, but now it is frozen/deprecated in Mono, so the evolution is going to happen in this Managed Commons project.

__Commons.GetOptions 1.0.0 is now available as a Nuget:__ [Commons.GetOptions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Commons.GetOptions/).

Also included here is the  __Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR__ library that has a helper class to convert a numerical value 
to it's textual representation in the Brazilian Portuguese language.

__Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR 1.0.0 is now available as a Nuget:__ [Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR/).

Both libraries above are stable releases.

## This is just the aggregating project  ##

__Commons.Locale.Helpers.pt_BR already moved to__ [managed-commons-locale-helpers-pt_BR](https://github.com/monoman/managed-commons-locale-helpers-pt_BR).

__Commons.GetOptions already moved to__ [managed-commons-getoptions](https://github.com/monoman/managed-commons-getoptions).
